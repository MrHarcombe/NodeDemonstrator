Trying to build a drag and drop Tkinter application to help visualise various graph algorithms.

Steps involved
- drag and drop interface to build a graph
- step-by-step BFS / DFS from a given start point (with or without end point)
- then add further algorithms, to include
  - Dijkstra and A* shortest path
  - Kruskal, Prim, etc
